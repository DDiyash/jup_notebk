I am uploading all the practice jupyter notebook files into this repository. Spotify jupyter file contains exploratory data analysis of the songs streamed and usage of different platforms. The second file that is Customer Segmentation is a jupyter file for exploratory data analysis based on demographic and behavioral instances of customers and also clustering based on k means for clustering(grouping) of customers based on similarities and logistic regeression for finding the odd ratio test to find if recency has any relation between responses from customers through campaigns. The tutorial from which i have used the code is "Free CodeCamp" blog and the link is "https://github.com/ibrahim-ogunbiyi/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/Customer%20Segmentation.ipynb". I have included the datasets i have used for practicing.
